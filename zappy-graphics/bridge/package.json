  "description": "This application establishes a bridge connection between a browser client and a TCP server. Browser is connected through the use of websockets (via webtcp library). The use of a bridge is necessary because of browser sandboxes: a browser application is not allowed to establish socket connections other than websockets (communicating with the http protocol). To communicate with a non-http server, http requests must be intercepted by the bridge and their raw data transmitted to the target server.",
